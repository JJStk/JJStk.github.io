The y is for an orderly work environment. It can't run strings, unless you go back and change data to a string variable (at least I think that's right, you might need to replace the word itself with string, but I'm sure it's just that it currently is an int variable). Other than that, thanks Bro Code, for showing me the how to's and leaving online guides to help others code.
