I'm very glad this works, I had some errors, but I finally figured out how to write and read files. I really am surprised that I could figure this out, but I did ask chatGPT how I would go about making the separate entry questions, and after looking through the explanation it gave me, I figured out how to do it myself. I am doing separate notes due to the finnicky nature of this code though.
