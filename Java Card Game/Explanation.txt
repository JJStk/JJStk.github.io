The functioning game is in the GPT conv. folder. The only way to get my code back out of the conversion software and ChatGPT was by Notepad, then I converted them from .txt to .java, that's why there's text file versions.


I did not have time to bug fix a new version of the game, but then I remembered that JavaScript is like Java but with more commands (how Mojang makes an entire version of Minecraft, and keep it updated, out of Java is beyond me). Anyways, I thought there may be an online conversion site or software that wasn't ChatGPT that could make a functioning version of the code I already wrote in the wrong coding language. It didn't work as well, bringing up trivial errors that I didn't have time to fix. So, what I did instead was go to ChatGPT to see if it could convert my code and keep it functioning. It did have to rewrite two commands for getting the card data to display the winner and each hand, but other than that, the conversion went smoothly and it functions in VScode.
