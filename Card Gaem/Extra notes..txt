Hi, this is James. I am adding this .txt file in hopes of it not breaking the others or GitHub by being a Word Document. I am admitting it here, I couldn't figure out where to start without help from ChatGPT 4.0 mini. I asked where to start this project, asked for help figuring out bugs and how to test for them, and I also asked how I could add more personality to the code. I didn't just take the code though, except for the version called GPT Gaem and GPT card game, I added those to show a streamlined version of the code that I made with the different groups. ChatGPT helped with a lot of bugs (that's why there's two GPT games, debugging on VScode was harder than asking how to make an html file to test my code) and helped me finally get to where it is now, a functional browser card game with GPT made visuals so you don't need to open developer view to look at the console. After everything worked, I was impressed and amazed with how far this game has come and how well it works. So a thanks is in order for ChatGPT to get this card game functioning, and also to Bro Code on YouTube for helping me figure out most of my previous projects as well.
